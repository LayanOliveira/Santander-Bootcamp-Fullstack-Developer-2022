# Syntax and Operators

## Task

- Create a function that receives two numbers as parameters.
- Check if the numbers are equals.
- Check if the sum of the numbers are higher than 10 or less than 20.
- Return a string saying "The numbers `num1` and `num2` are/aren't equal. Your sum is `sum`, which is `higher/lower` than 10 and `higher/lower` than 20".

Example:

```
Input: 1, 2
Output: The numbers 1 and 2 aren't equals. Your sum is 3, which is lower than 10 and lower than 20.
```
